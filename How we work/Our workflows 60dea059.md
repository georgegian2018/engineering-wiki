# How we communicate

Acme values clear, concise, transparent, and asynchronous communication. Here are our most important modes of communication:

- The head of Engineering at Acme [@Roland](https://help.nuclino.com/988f802d-mention-a-team-member "Mention a team member") hosts a **monthly team meeting** every first Monday of the month at 11 am PST. Everyone is welcome to attend. Use [this link](https://help.nuclino.com/ddaabe07-use-external-links "Use external links") to join.
- Join our engineering **Slack channels**:
  - [#development](https://help.nuclino.com/ddaabe07-use-external-links "Use external links")
  - [#production](https://help.nuclino.com/ddaabe07-use-external-links "Use external links")
- Whenever possible, start a discussion with a **merge request** (MR) instead of an issue. An MR is associated with a specific change that is proposed and transparent for everyone to review and openly discuss. An issue will take longer to take action on.
- When you do **open an issue**, use [GitLab Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues).
