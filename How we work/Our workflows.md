Learn how we communicate, collaborate, and get things done at Acme.

# How we communicate

Acme values clear, concise, transparent, and asynchronous communication. Here are our most important modes of communication:

- The head of Engineering at Acme hosts a **monthly team meeting** every first Monday of the month at 11 am PST. Everyone is welcome to attend. Use [this link] to join.
- Join our engineering **Slack channels**:
  - [#development]
  - [#production]
- Whenever possible, start a discussion with a **merge request** (MR) instead of an issue. An MR is associated with a specific change that is proposed and transparent for everyone to review and openly discuss. An issue will take longer to take action on.
- When you do **open an issue**, use [GitLab Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues).
